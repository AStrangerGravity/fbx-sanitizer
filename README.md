# fbx-sanitizer
FBX Sanitizer is a CLI application to check FBX files for common issues such as scaling, rotationg, mesh sizes, etc. These issues cause issues when importing the FBX into Unity or Blender, and generally guarantee that when the file is opened in a 3D application, it will load reliably.

See `checks/` for the list of checks and reasonings.
